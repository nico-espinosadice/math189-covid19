### Research Question:
Is the death rate of US states correlated with their racial demographics?  

### Data: 
I test the relationship between the racial demographics of states and their death rates. I obtained data from World Population Review ([link](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/states-by-race/)) about the racial demographics of each state. I also used data from The Covid Tracking Project ([link](https://covidtracking.com/data)) which included the number of cases and deaths of each state.

### Methods:
I use linear regression to evaluate correlation between the racial demographics of each state. The code is in the file.

### Results:

![Regression: Asian Americans](Results/Regression_Asian_Americans.png)
![Regression: Two or More Races](Results/Regression_2MoreRaces.png)
    
### Discussion:
The regression shows a negative slope for the model involing white Americans and people of two or more races, and a negative slope for the model involving African Americans and Asian Americans. This demonstrates support for my hypothesis, since the regression involving African Americans had a positive slope. However, I cannot draw too many conclusions from these results given the low R^2 value of the regression models.
